# Network Dashboard

A simple dashboard to monitor and access your local network services.

## What it does
- Checks if services are reachable and shows last-checked time
- Add, edit, and delete services; organize with categories and colors
- Import/export your setup as JSON; settings persist locally
- Shows overall internet connectivity status
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile

## Quick start
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the app: `npm run dev`
3. Open `http://localhost:5173`

## Configure services
- Use "Add Service" to create entries (name, URL, description, category, icon)
- Toggle network checks per service if you want reachability status
- Use Import/Export to back up or share configurations
- When sharing configs publicly, use example hosts (e.g., `service.example.local`) to avoid exposing internal details
